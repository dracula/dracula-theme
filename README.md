## FAQ

###### "Are you going to create a light color scheme?"

Nope. Dracula can't stand the light.

###### "Are you going to support editor X?"

We hope so, but we need your help to accomplish that. Since you're already using app X you're probably much more experienced in it than us. So give it a try first!

###### "How do I submit a new theme?"

1. Create a new repository based on this [template](https://github.com/dracula/template).
2. Build the new theme using the [Color Palette](#color-palette) above.
3. Finally, [submit an issue](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/issues/new) with a link to your repository. Once the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the Dracula organization and give you rights to maintain it 😀

The colors maintain a `4.5:1` contrast ratio, complying with [WCAG 2.1 | Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

## Team

Dracula is a project created by [Zeno Rocha](https://github.com/zenorocha/) with the help of many awesome contributors and maintainers. Each theme has its own maintainer listed in the Team section of its README.

## Organization

Over the years Dracula has grown to support many more editors. With that came the challenge of supporting a myriad of editors, terminals, shells, and more in the same repository. Some package managers require specific files and layouts which cause conflicts and make it harder to maintain.

So it was decided to change Dracula from a one repository theme to an organization. All themes have now been migrated to their own repository. With this change we can better support package managers, list maintainers, make installation instructions easier to find, and support independent releases.

See [Dracula organization](https://github.com/dracula) for all of our repositories.
